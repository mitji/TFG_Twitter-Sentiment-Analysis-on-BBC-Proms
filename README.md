# TFG_Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-on-BBC-Proms

*NOTE: The code in this repository is not prepared to be cloned and executed*

This repository contains part of the code I have developed to carry out my Bachelor's degree final project. Other scripts

The goal of the project was to perform Sentiment Analysis on a set of tweets from the BBC Proms, one of the most important classical music festivals.
In order to classify the tweets, two types of classifiers are built: machine learning and deep learning.

## Folder structure
 - ```classifiers```: two Jupyter Notebooks with implementations for each of the twitter classifiers
 - ```pre-processing```: scripts to apply text-preprocessing on twitter data
 - ```helpers```: handy scripts to perform a number of operations during the pre-processing and data preparation process.

If you want to use part of this code, you must take into account that you may have to personalize it to your task at-hand, but this can become a very fun process!
